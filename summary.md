##### Dataset
* prepared
* removed anomaly
* balanced (equal quantity of classes)
  * adding of minor classes
    * augmentation method
        * picture
          * mirroring
          * rotate
  * reduce of major classes

##### Algorithm of ML for business
1. Define class of the task
2. Define method to solve the task
3. Define ground truth dataset, compare with the business dataset to find out the lack or sufficiency of features
4. Solve the optimization task (reduce error of function)
